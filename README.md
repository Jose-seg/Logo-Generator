# Logo-Generator

## Description 
This app runs in the backend, using various packages in node to ensure that it worked, it's purpose is to generate a logo that is 
created when a user answers a series of prompts and once they finish all the questions, then a .svg file with the given file name
is created with a logo that contains text inside of it. This app runs using inquirer and svg, however I did have to install additional packages to make 
my app functional.

## Usage 
The usage of the app is to not only generate a logo, but as well as a means of practicing testing. When a user runs the app in the backend, then the user will be
asked to answer a series of prompts, these prompts will help the app now how exactly the user wants their app to appear when openend in the browser. A .svg file will be created and it 
will be named according to the response from the user. This app also provides a means of practicing making failing test into passing ones, getting the test to past made me understand the errors when it came to running index.mjs in node.
